Order of progress:

1 - Determination of page numbers

2 - Determination of page functions

3 - SessionStorage is going to be used to port over the User Registration Data

4 - The Site will have a Header and Footer, The Header will contain the Navigation Bar  (Buttons)

5 - The 3 different Pages are going to each have a different Picture

6 - The confirmation Page will have a return button

7 - The button will copy the Data over into new Variables which will then be separately saved as SessionStorage. These variables are pulled when the booking page loads and filled into the imput fields so the user doesn't have to retype everything again.

8 - The email validation will be done with Regex, it would be too much work to write new functions just for it.
